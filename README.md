Cross browser Speech Synthesis

This project was created, because it's always a struggle to get the synthesis
part of `Web Speech API` running on most major browsers.

**Note:** this is not a polyfill package, if your target browser does not 
support speech synthesis or the Web Speech API, this package is not usable.
  
## Install

Install from npm via

```bash
$ npm install easy-speech
``` 

## Usage

Import `EasySpeech` and first, detect, if your browser is capable of tts (text
to speech):

```javascript
import EasySpeech from 'easy-speech'

EasySpeech.detect()
```

it returns an Object with the following information:

```javascript
{
  speechSynthesis: SpeechSynthesis|undefined,
  speechSynthesisUtterance: SpeechSynthesisUtterance|undefined,
  speechSynthesisVoice: SpeechSynthesisVoice|undefined,
  speechSynthesisEvent: SpeechSynthesisEvent|undefined,
  speechSynthesisErrorEvent: SpeechSynthesisErrorEvent|undefined,
  onvoiceschanged: Boolean,
  onboundary: Boolean,
  onend: Boolean,
  onerror: Boolean,
  onmark: Boolean,
  onpause: Boolean,
  onresume: Boolean,
  onstart: Boolean
}
```

If at least `SpeechSynthesis` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` are defined you
are good to go.


### Initialize

Preparing everything to work is not as clear as it should, especially when 
targeting cross-browser functionality. The asynchronous init function will help
you with this situation:

```javascript
EasySpeech.init({ maxTimeout: 5000, interval: 250 })
    .then(() => console.debug('load complete'))
    .catch(e => console.error(e))
``` 

It will go through several stages to setup the environment:

- detect and that SpeechSynthesis is basically supported, if not -> fail
- load voices directly
- if not loaded but `onvoiceschanged` is available: use `onvoiceschanged`
- if `onvoiceschanged` is not available: fallback to timeout
- if `onvoiceschanged` is fired but no voices available: fallback to timeout
- timeout reloads voices in a given `interval` until a `maxTimeout` is reached
- if voices are loaded until then -> complete
- if no voices found -> fail 

### Speak a voice
